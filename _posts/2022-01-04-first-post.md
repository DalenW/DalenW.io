First post! 
Took me about half an hour to figure out how to use jekyll and import a theme.
We'll see where this little blog goes.
I'll try to bring over some of the tools I wrote on the old site onto this website as well, but that's far down on my list of things to do.

I may be backlogging posts, but the date of this post is the date this website was created.
