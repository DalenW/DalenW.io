My name is Dalen Ward. 
I'm currently studying Computer Science at Utah Valley University. 
Big fan Ruby on Rails, and right now most of my content will reflect that. 

This replaced my old website, which was a super ugly and does not represent my skills.
Currently I'm a fullstack developer, but my strength is backend development.
I've dabbled in a lot of things concerning computers in general, but this seems to be what I like the most and I want to push that to the max.

Any open source projects that are good enough to show off I'll talk about here.

Currently, most of my public GitHub repositories are things I worked on in High School or early college, despite my GitHub contributions overview being mostly green.
